# Image SEO tips:
# #1 Rename your images, they should be descriptive
#   rename your images (it affects your seo!) use keywords!
#   keyword reasearch: select and use one "focus" keyword and Supporting keywords for Each page and Blog post (The focus keyword is simply the search term you want your post or page to be ranked for in the search engines. So when the audience looks out for that specific phrase or keyword in the search engines, they should probably locate you.)
#   Use hyphens, not underscores, to separate wordsâ€”for example, query-data.html. Search engines interpret hyphens in file and directory names as spaces between words. Underscores are generally not recognized, meaning that their presence can negatively affect SEO. (Source: https://developers.google.com/style/filenames#:~:text=Use%20hyphens%2C%20not%20underscores%2C%20to,presence%20can%20negatively%20affect%20SEO.)
# #2 Write seo friendly alt text -> search engines, screen readers, and people with disabilities
#   Do not forget to set the alt text for the image (you can just take the image and remove its hyphens conveniently)
# #3 Use jpg or jpeg (I will go with jpeg)
# Ideally images should be less than 100 kb. But I will keep it below 200 kb for now. Should be fine. (Amazon images are around 150 kbs)
# for actual image keep the longest side below 1500 px (That's what amazon does)
# for thumbnails keep the longest side below 800 px, also use the webp format for them. Their file size should be less than 72 kb (That's also how amazon does)
# for any images that span the entire width of the browser, images should be 2560 pixels in width,

# below will be my algorithm:
# 1 First copy all the files to a new folder, then:
# 2 convert to jpeg, and change its name
# 3 resize the image and check its size again. If its above 200 kbs then:
# 4 optimize the image
# 5 optimize the image another way

# Operating System package for python. This enables us to make changes in our files (like creating, deleting, altering) on our computer
import os

# PIL stands for Python Imaging Library, and it's the original library that enabled Python to deal with images.
# We will also use ImageOps to prevent the image being rotated while we change (reduce) its dimensions

# Below package is for copying files from one directory to another

# Below is for converting png to jpg. (OpenCV) It actually does very other things like machine learning. But we will use it simply in here.
